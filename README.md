# Design-Patterns

 * A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
 * Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers.
 * Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. 
 
 ## Types of Design Patterns
 
 ### Creational

* Abstract Factory(Creates an instance of several families of classes)
* Builder (Separates object construction from its representation)
* Factory Method (Creates an instance of several derived classes)
* Prototype (A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned)
* Singleton (A class of which only a single instance can exist)
 
### Structural
 
* Adapter Pattern (Adapting an interface into another according to client expectation)
* Bridge Pattern (Separating abstraction (interface) from implementation)
* Composite Pattern (Allowing clients to operate on hierarchy of objects)
* Decorator Pattern (Adding functionality to an object dynamically)
* Facade Pattern (Providing an interface to a set of interfaces)
* Flyweight Pattern(Reusing an object by sharing it)
* proxy Pattern (Representing another object)
 
 
 ### Behavioural
 
* Observer (A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* State (Alter an object's behavior when its state changes)
* Strategy (Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class)
* Template method (Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass)
* Visitor (Defines a new operation to a class without change)
